(** ## Let's build a compiler! **)

(** ## What will we be building? **)

(** We will be building a compiler and type-checker for a pure, total, functional language with clojure-like syntax in a structured editor.

    If you really want to go for deep understanding, maybe try all three :) **)

(** ## An Overview of the process: **)

(** We'll be building a series of compilers, gradually getting more feature-rich, and correspondingly more fun to use.

This compiler will be as simple as is reasonable while also giving us a language that's nice to use. This will consist of a parser (which will convert the \"concrete syntax tree\" of the structured editor into the \"Abstract Syntax Tree\" of our language) and a \"tree-walking interpreter\", which will traverse the AST and produce the resulting value. We'll also implement some basic static analysis, just enough to allow the editor or order our terms in dependency order.","styles":{}}],"children":[]}
    cannot convert {"id":"0ad80d0e-1284-4193-9b4b-6d58c809f8dc","type":"numberedListItem","props":{"textColor":"default","backgroundColor":"default","textAlignment":"left"},"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Next we'll use the language L1 to produce a code generator, which will take our AST and produce JavaScript.

No! Now we need a type checker! This is where it really gets fun, because other tutorials tend to stick to parsing + code generation, and if you want to do type inference you're stuck reading a ton of academic papers ðŸ˜…. Well, I've done that reading for you, and we'll start with a lightly extended implementation of \"Algorithm W\" (adding in pattern matching and custom data types).","styles":{}}],"children":[]}

    And that completes L1! Up to this point, everything we've written would be parseable & runnable by our original bootstrap implementation. Going forward, we'll have fancier language features like Type Classes and Algebraic Effects, which require information from the Type Inference step in order to produce the compiled output.  **)
