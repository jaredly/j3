- [ ] come up with a syntax that can handle things
- [x] make a tight grammar (text -> CST)
- [ ] see if I can speedrun simple parsing and evaluation (CST -> AST -> TS)
	because, lets have something we can play with ya know
	- we'll gloss over type inference for now
	- and also maybe type checking? like idk. can we just ... check types, and see if they check out?
- [ ] thennn we're on to a structured editor! All day. (UI <-> CST)
