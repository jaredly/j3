- [x] come up with a syntax that can handle things
- [x] make a tight grammar (text -> CST)
- [x] see if it can handle glsl? hmm yeah I think so
- [x] see if I can speedrun simple parsing and evaluation (CST -> AST -> TS)
	because, lets have something we can play with ya know
	- we'll gloss over type inference for now
	- and also maybe type checking? like idk. can we just ... check types, and see if they check out?
	- [ ] so like I dont have generics yet, and such. but I think it's pretty good.
- [-] thennn we're on to a structured editor! All day. (UI <-> CST)

# Structure Editor

- [x] render basic.clj
- [x] click to select
- [x] basic atom edit
- [x] basic space to next atom add tx
- [ ] space in middle should split ty
- [x] '(' should make a list, '[' array, '{' record
- [x] backspace should deleteeeee
- [ ] backspace should joiiiin
- [x] invalid syntax should be allowwwwwed (made a new kind of node, a "badsyntax" or sth)
- [x] basic left & rightttt

## Ok but let's do prettier.
so updateStore should include a list of paths, so we know who to recalculate.

- [x] figure out a little multiline
- [x] actually compute the whatsits
- [x] try out better hugging
- [x] oh lets get rainbow parens prolly

so good

## More nav and stuff

- [x] left & right outside of a list
  - [x] this means we need the concept of focusing the start / end of a listylisty (and a non-idx IdentifierLike)

- [x] backspace inside/start/end of listlike works!
- [x] backspace from start w/ empty before, deletes it
- [x] typing normal things in a blank creates a new thing


# Getting Full Input, because that would be nice

I want to be able to write an actual program

- [ ] so, I'm thinking the grammar shouldn't care about type annotations and decorators and whatnot?





## SELECTION

- [ ] clicking the deadspace should do something reasonably my goodness
	- [x] inline deadspace fixed!

gotta do a bunch

### Mouse Selection

### Keyboard Selection???
