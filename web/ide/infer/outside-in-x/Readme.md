Trying to implement OutsideIn(X) from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/jfp-outsidein.pdf

Ok, so Simon was very nice to send me links to two talks I can draw on:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TJGhGa04F8
and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3evzO8O9e8

Maybe I can ask for the slides as well? Not totally sure I'd need it though.

So in that talk he references the paper "The Essence of ML Type Inference", which is the source of the `mini` directory, so that's nice.
That does kindof leave me with the question "what is the outsidein paper doing that's extra and special"?
Like, How does it relate to HM(X) also idk.

And at the end of the day, I would love to have recursive row types, and then I think I'd be satisfied?

Maybe HM(X) only did local constraint solving?
