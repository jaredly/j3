# Progress

ok!!!
We have a bunch of things!!!!!
including records
which appear to work just as I would like

oh lol I don't have let I don't think

- [x] fn
- [x] var
- [x] int
- [x] char
- [x] record (create, access)
- [x] let

and thennnn oh maybe try out their switch logic?
yeah
and then try to make type constructors purely structural

- [ ] see if I can do like literal number types? That would be so cool
