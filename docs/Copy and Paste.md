# Copy and Paste

In a structure-first language (projectional language), you can't just copy & paste
some text from the web into your editor and expect it to work.
Because the flat text representation is going to be missing some important
information.

For that reason, we'll want *either*:
- [ ] code blocks on our website, which when you select & copy, do js magic to
      give you the full experience
- [ ] a json blob or something below the text for copying? Seems a little sus

And if you're copying some code from your editor to share, maybe you want to be able to
like "create a link to share just term" and it will give you a URL that will load up
that term in the environment?? maybe???
