Ideas from POPL:

- Grove-like CmRDT for collaborative editing, let's goo
- "one-hole contexts" sounds so cool, let's allow de-selecting elements within a selection!
- Can I prove that going from CST to AST is a regular expression?
- ok now what does type inference look like

# Assembly

https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/macos-assembly-http-server/blob/main/server.s

What if I made a language called like 'almost assembly'
is that what c is trying to be? maybe.
but it would have ... a better type system? idk.
I'd probably have to learn more assembly.

...
cannn we make things compile & run ... while there are errors living somewhere?

# Lamdu
lots of cool things here. I should try using lamdu for real.
the 'named arguments' thing is interesting, but I'm interested to know how it feels.

# Hazel
ohhh the hole-based programming is so cool. "See the scope at the moment the hole was created".
How hard would that be for me to support?

Also livelits, good stuff.

# Lamdu live eval & types & stuff

-> the type error is shown on the *more recently edited* dealio, if there's a conflict between two things.
