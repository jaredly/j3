So, one of the cool things you get when you don't need first-class flat text, is comments can get a lot more interesting.

You can have a "review comment" that's written right into the code, and committed to the codebase.
Merging comments is a non-issue.

Comments will all be "attached" to nodes, semantically. ?? right?
hmm.

So actually, there are multiple things.

## Inline documentation

## Node-specific commentary

Attached to an individual node, displayed as a tooltip or such.
Can have different 'log levels' - debug / info / warning
(you could also have a setting to hide all type annotations if you're hiding 'info'-level comments)



## General commentary
