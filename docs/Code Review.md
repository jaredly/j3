So, one of the cool things you get when you don't need first-class flat text, is comments can get a lot more interesting.

You can have a "review comment" that's written right into the code, and committed to the codebase.
Merging comments is a non-issue.

Comments will all be "attached" to nodes, semantically. ?? right?
hmm.

So actually, there are multiple things.

## Node-specific commentary

Attached to an individual node, displayed as a tooltip or such.
Can have different 'log levels' - debug / info / warning
(you could also have a setting to hide all type annotations if you're hiding 'info'-level comments)

## General commentary

This is its own node, probably rendered as markdown?

## Review comments

Are just node-specific I think? 
Well it would be good to allow them anywhere.

## QUESTION

How do I represent ~github issues?
Would those be ... comments as well? Of a certain type?
hmmmm.

They could be ~markdown terms, although that feels like shoe-horning.
