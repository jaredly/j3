So, similar to the way I'm planning to have "migrateable data" be ~opt-in (where the default is to need to write the conversion yourself), what would it look like to have CRDTs supported at a language level?

like you could say
```
(deftype person (@sync {
	name string
	age int
}))
```
And that would expand to ... something ... that woud ... hmmm
would it make it so that your DATA has a color?
That would be kindof annoying?
hmm.

like, can't use sync'd and non-sync'd types together.
hmm.

coulddddd it be just an attribute of the runtime???
that would be quiteee interesting?

hmmmmmmm would you then ... just turn on sync for the whole dealio?
ðŸ¤”
yeah tbh that might be the best.
ðŸ¤” well are there custom things we'd need to specify?

Hmmm yeah ok, so modifications have to happen in a special way, right?
